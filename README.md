This will be compatible with 0.6.0.1 mods and future versions, but might also be compatible with older mods.

## What can this do
This program modifies the Nodes and Synapses to make them compatible with a modded template,
whilest trying to keep the original function of the bibite as unchainged as possible.

## How to run
### Setup
1. Download TemplateToModdedTemplate.py.
2. Place TemplateToModdedTemplate.py into a folder.
3. Run TemplateToModdedTemplate.py once then close.
4. Add a template that is a modded bibite into "Template bb8" folder that is created.

### Converting
1. Run TemplateToModdedTemplate.py
2. Click "Open Template Bibite", choose a template from "Template bb8" (This needs to be compatible with the mod you decide to use).
3. Click "Open bibite you want to convert", choose a template from The bibites template folder (This needs to be compatible with 0.6.0.1).
4. Now Click "Convert bibite", this converts the bibite template and it is now compatible with the mod you are using.
5. The last step is to click "Save converted bibite", choose a bibite template you are ok with overwriting now. The bibite template is now overwritten with the converted bibite.
